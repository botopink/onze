# onze

> Path: `repository/onze/`
> Parent (workspace): [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) · Sibling (core): [`../botopink-lang/AGENTS.md`](../botopink-lang/AGENTS.md)
> Specs: `specs/1.0.10-beta/06-onze/` in the meta repository (`modules.md` is the cut)

The **Next.js-style orchestrator**: the one package that imports rakun, jhonstart, the
`jhonstart-emilia` bridge and emilia together (decision 113) — neither rakun nor jhonstart names
onze, and every value that crosses between them is handed across by `Onze.run`. Pure `.bp`
client, zero compiler-core surface, reached via `from "onze"`.

The workspace and its nine members exist (front 95, `onze-server` — decision pending 49-e — and
`onze-content`, front 121):
rakun is erlang-only (decision 117), so the rakun half of the boot lives in the erlang member
`onze-server` and the core stays on both rows. The name came from the old mocking library, archived
under the tag `mocking-lib-final` (decision 79); nothing of it is here, and its surface is std's
`testing.mocks` / `testing.asserts`.

The snapshot engine is the `snap` library (decision 391): the members whose tests record a `.snap`
(`onze`, `onze-assets`, `onze-bundler`, `onze-cli`, `onze-og`, `onze-release`, `onze-test`) declare
it in `dependencies` (`{ "snap": { "git": "https://github.com/botopink/snap.git", "branch": "feat" } }`)
and write `import {assertAs} from "snap";`.

## Rules

- A member depends on a sibling with `{ "workspace": true }` only; on another library's member by
  `path` (`{ "rakun": { "path": "../../../rakun/modules/rakun" } }`) — added by the front whose
  code needs the edge, never ahead of it. A member lists exactly the packages its sources and
  tests import: dependencies load transitively (decision 143). `std` — the one bundled
  package (decision 326) — is never listed; `routing`, `actions`, `validation` are declared
  like any library (`{ "git": "https://github.com/botopink/<pkg>.git", "branch": "feat" }`).
- A member may only **restrict** the workspace's `targets`, and only structurally (gate-d): the
  excluded target's `botopink build` must fail on a host binding (`has no #[@External.<Target>]`),
  never on a checker error, and a member that builds there runs there. Today one member
  restricts: `onze-server` is `["erlang"]` — its commonJS build fails on rakun's hosts (`rkReqLive`,
  `rkBeanStore`, … `have no #[@External] for the node backend`); the rest, `onze-cli` and `onze-og`
  included, run on both rows. Nothing on both rows imports rakun (every rakun manifest is
  `["erlang"]`, decision 117) — that is `onze-server`'s.
- One module cannot hold two types of one name: an `as` alias of an imported type still binds its
  declared name (`language-gaps.md`). `onze-server` constructs rakun's `App` and holds
  jhonstart's only as the core's `SiteRender` function value.
- The front that adds a module appends its `pub mod` line and its `files` entry in its own commit
  (`06-onze/modules.md` § Front → submodule ownership names the owner of each `root.bp`).
- An imported module's body runs before the importer's, on every backend (decision 140). The
  staged app's `onze_routes.bp` imports every decorated convention file and registers the
  undecorated ones (`loading`, `error`, `not-found`); the server's `onze_main.bp` imports
  `onze_routes` and registers every `#[page]` / `#[layout]` / `#[template]` / `#[defaultView]`
  function from the program's catalogue — `jhRegisterRoutes(@TypeInfo.all(with: page), …)`
  (decision 216); a marker registers nothing itself.
- A test writes only under `BOTOPINK_TEST_TMPDIR` (each suite's `testTmp()`); a build a test
  runs moves its `outDir` there, so nothing is written into the checkout.
- A test reads only tracked sources, never a tree another cell writes: the gate's cells run side by
  side, each member's `.botopinkbuild/` appearing and vanishing under the others. A scan over the
  members lists `modules/` and walks each member's own `src/` (`onze-assets`'s flush gate,
  `memberSources` in `test/stylesheet_test.bp`) — never a recursive walk of `..` or the root.
- Any code or layout change updates this file in the same commit.

## Local gate

`git config core.hooksPath scripts/git-hooks` once per clone. `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`
sources `scripts/git-hooks/lib/runner-standalone.sh`; the gate's stages, in order — each one a
refusal (decision 67: fail beats warn), none with a flag, variable or list that turns it off:

1. **staged files** — no `*.snap.new` / `*.snap.md.new` (both are in `.gitignore`; the hook
   catches a `git add -f`) and no conflict marker;
2. **the compiler** — `$BOTOPINK_BIN` when it is set (a value that is not an executable is a
   refusal, never a reason to pick another compiler), else the enclosing checkout's
   `repository/botopink-lang/zig-out/bin/botopink` (the walk stops at the first ancestor that
   holds `repository/botopink-lang/`), else a botopink-lang checkout's own `zig-out`, else
   `$PATH`. None → the gate fails, naming `zig build install` and `BOTOPINK_BIN`. The path is
   exported as `BOTOPINK_BIN`: `onze-cli`'s fixture suites compile with the compiler that runs
   them;
3. **repository stages** — `scripts/git-hooks/repository-stages.sh`, when a repository tracks
   one. onze has none;
4. **tests** — `botopink test --target <t>` in every workspace member (every directory the root
   manifest's `workspaces` patterns expand to: the nine `modules/*` and `examples/{blog,scaffold}`)
   on every target its manifest declares — 21 cells: ten members on both rows, `onze-server` on
   erlang. A member with no `test` block (`scaffold`) is still compiled;
   the cells run side by side on the runner's pool (`gatePool`: one per CPU,
   bounded by `MemAvailable / 768 MiB`, a cell started only while the runnable
   threads are at most the CPUs), and the report is printed in plan order once
   every cell has finished — the lines the one-at-a-time hook printed, cell for
   cell; stage 5's builds run the same way (1.0.11-beta front 115: emilia's
   serial hook measured ~4 000 s);
5. **examples** — `botopink build --target <t>` of every `examples/*/` on every declared target,
   into a throwaway `--out`: 4 builds;
6. **refusals** — every `refusals/*/` case, when the directory exists. onze has none.

Stages 1–3 stop the gate at the first red. Stages 4–6 all run: every red cell is listed with the
tail of its output and a re-run line, and the gate fails at the end — one run tells every red.
Measured 2026-10-02 with the compiler built from botopink-lang `29cfffc8`: 17 of 19 cells green, 4/4
builds, exit 1 — the two reds are `onze-cli` on both targets (`test/start_test.bp:120` on both,
`test/start_test.bp:103` and `test/build_test.bp:63` on erlang — `06-onze` and the compiler rows
the front README names), listed by the one run with every other cell's verdict. Never commit
with `--no-verify`; fix the red instead.

`pre-commit` and `lib/runner-standalone.sh` are one text in the five library repositories
(emilia, erika, jhonstart, onze, rakun): the meta repository's `hook-integrity` workflow compares
the bytes (its check 4), so a change to either lands in all five together. What only one
repository checks lives in that repository's `scripts/git-hooks/repository-stages.sh`, which the
runner runs in a child process — it can add a red, it cannot remove or skip a shared stage.

The same cells, discovered by the runner from the workspace root, are CI's:
`cd $(mktemp -d) && BOTOPINK_LIB_ROOTS=<this repository> botopink-lib-test --bin "$BOTOPINK_BIN"
--target <t> --strict`, on `{ubuntu-24.04, macos-14} × {commonJS, erlang}` — every row hard, no
windows row (gate-f: botopink-lang has none; it returns with the compiler's), `ubuntu-24.04`
(the compiler links against a pinned glibc 2.35 — decision 219, ubuntu-22.04's — so it starts
on either runner; the 22.04 floor is the compiler's own workflow's). OTP 28 and Node 22 are installed on
every row (OTP 28 pinned on both runners — the release the root `botopink.json`'s `"otp"` names (`"28"`), read by a step before the installs (decision 228; the compiler refuses any other `erl` on PATH) — `erlef/setup-beam` on linux, `brew install erlang@<release> && brew link --force erlang@<release>` with its `bin` on `$GITHUB_PATH` on macos (decision 227; Homebrew's plain `erlang` is the latest OTP), and a step after both fails the job unless `erl` reports that release; `zig build install` runs `erlc`; the cli suites drive `node`); jhonstart, emilia and
rakun are checked out under `botopink-lang/repository/` as the `path` dependencies the manifests
declare, and `actions`, `routing` and `validation` (at `feat`) as the `git` dependencies they declare,
transitively — onze's members, jhonstart's and rakun's, and `actions` itself declares `routing`;
a `git` dependency resolves by name through that root (decision 326) — dependencies, never rows.

A `targets` restriction is audited by building the member on the excluded target: `onze-server`'s
commonJS build fails on rakun's host bindings, so its `["erlang"]` stands; `onze-cli` (erlang) and
`onze-og` (commonJS) built, so their lines were deleted and both run on both rows.
